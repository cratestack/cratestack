## 0.8.0

- Initial package structure (cratestack#563). One uniform `CratestackCborCodec`
  API, auto-selected per platform:
  - Native: flutter_rust_bridge over a vendored prebuilt library. This
    release vendors **Linux x86_64 and Android (arm64-v8a, x86_64,
    armeabi-v7a)** — the remaining platform matrix (iOS, macOS, Windows,
    Linux arm64) is follow-up work.
  - Web: the existing `cratestack-cbor-wasm` wasm-bindgen artifact,
    vendored and loaded via `dart:js_interop`.
- Not yet published to pub.dev — see README.md.
- Flutter app integration, proven by real builds (cratestack#563):
  - Linux: a Flutter FFI plugin (`linux/CMakeLists.txt`) bundles the
    vendored `.so` into a real `flutter build linux` app, instead of the
    `cargokit` build-Rust-from-source pattern most flutter_rust_bridge
    plugins use.
  - Android: a Flutter FFI plugin (`android/build.gradle`) packages the
    vendored per-ABI `.so` files into the APK via the standard `jniLibs`
    mechanism — no CMake/NDK invocation at consumer build time. Verified
    by a real `flutter build apk`, per-ABI presence assertion, and a
    real install-and-run on an Android emulator round-tripping CBOR.
  - Web: `pubspec.yaml`'s `flutter: assets:` vendors the `.js`/`.wasm`
    pair so a release `flutter build web` actually ships them; the web
    loader now tries both the dev-server and release asset URL
    conventions.
  - `example/`: a minimal Flutter app exercising the codec, verified with
    real `flutter build linux`/`flutter build web`/`flutter build apk`
    builds — see `just cbor-example-verify` and
    `just cbor-example-verify-android`.
